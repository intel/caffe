# Support Flow LRCN From Quadra_L
- [Quadra_L](http://www.swcontest.net/index.php?a=show&m=news&aid=177)
## Preparing
- install protocol buffer 3.4.0, referring this link http://blog.csdn.net/twilightdream/article/details/72953338
- sudo -H pip install --upgrade protobuf==3.1.0.post1
- sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev
- sudo apt-get install python-h5py
## Building
- remember WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1 !
- make all
- make pycaffe

## Training
- download data and models from http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lisa_anne/LRCN_video,
- change my path like '/home/link/frames' in sequence_input_layer.py to your path and modify other relative path.
- bash run_lstm_flow.sh, start training!

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.

# Intel® Distribution of Caffe*
This fork is dedicated to improving Caffe performance when running on CPU, in particular Intel® Xeon processors (HSW, BDW, Xeon Phi)

## Building
Build procedure is the same as on bvlc-caffe-master branch. Both Make and CMake can be used.
When OpenMP is available will be used automatically.

## Running
Run procedure is the same as on bvlc-caffe-master branch.

Current implementation uses OpenMP threads. By default the number of OpenMP threads is set
to the number of CPU cores. Each one thread is bound to a single core to achieve best
performance results. It is however possible to use own configuration by providing right
one through OpenMP environmental variables like OMP_NUM_THREADS or GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY.

If some system tool like numactl is used to control CPU affinity, by default caffe will prevent
to use more than one thread per core. When less than required cores are specified, caffe will
limit execution of OpenMP threads to specified cores only.

## Best performance solution
Please read [our Wiki](https://github.com/intel/caffe/wiki/Recommendations-to-achieve-best-performance) for our recommendations and configuration to achieve best performance on Intel CPUs. 

## Multinode Training
Intel® Distribution of Caffe* multi-node allows you to execute deep neural network training on multiple machines.

To understand how it works and read some tutorials, go to our Wiki. Start from [Multinode guide](https://github.com/intel/caffe/wiki/Multinode-guide).
