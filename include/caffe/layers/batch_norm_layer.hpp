/**
 * @brief Normalizes the input to have 0-mean and/or unit (1) variance across
 *        the batch.
 *
 * This layer computes Batch Normalization described in [1].  For
 * each channel in the data (i.e. axis 1), it subtracts the mean and divides
 * by the variance, where both statistics are computed across both spatial
 * dimensions and across the different examples in the batch.
 *
 * By default, during training time, the network is computing global mean/
 * variance statistics via a running average, which is then used at test
 * time to allow deterministic outputs for each input.  You can manually
 * toggle whether the network is accumulating or using the statistics via the
 * use_global_stats option.  IMPORTANT: for this feature to work, you MUST
 * set the learning rate to zero for all three parameter blobs, i.e.,
 * param {lr_mult: 0} three times in the layer definition.
 *
 * Note that the original paper also included a per-channel learned bias and
 * scaling factor.  It is possible (though a bit cumbersome) to implement
 * this in caffe using a single-channel DummyDataLayer filled with zeros,
 * followed by a Convolution layer with output the same size as the current.
 * This produces a channel-specific value that can be added or multiplied by
 * the BatchNorm layer's output.

 *     Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift." arXiv preprint
 *     arXiv:1502.03167 (2015).

 * TODO(dox): thorough documentation for Forward, Backward, and proto params.
